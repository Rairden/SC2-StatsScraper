If you play Starcraft 2, you can automatically upload your replays on https://sc2replaystats.com/

If you have an elite membership (perhaps $5-10/mo), you can use their plugin. Instead of paying, I wrote my own which simply downloads their web page showing game statistics.  

Here is what the web scraper looks like. And the game overlay using OBS.  

The script has functionality to switch between servers (since I switch from NA to EU server). Or you can type in `all` to show all games played in the past 24 hrs.
